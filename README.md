# BedUtils
### A simple light-weight plugin that modifies beds for a better multiplayer experience.

BedUtils contains some useful modules to make the multiplayer experience a little bit better. Setting a percentage for an amount of players needed to get to the next day is easy with this utility.

#### Useful
For developers, probably the most useful part of this open-source project is the way to calculate if the player is too far from a bed to go to sleep, you can check that out [here](https://github.com/JasperEdits/BedUtils/blob/master/src/main/java/me/jasperedits/bedutils/utils/MathUtils.java).
Thanks to KabesaKubo for helping me out.
